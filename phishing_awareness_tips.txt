STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE: How to Analyze a Phishing Email (Real-Time Task)
===================================================================

✅ Step 1: Get a Phishing Email Sample
-------------------------------------
Source: Real email received by me (Santhoshkumar).
Saved content directly from Gmail interface.

✅ Step 2: View the Sender's Email Address
------------------------------------------
From: Angela <evinog3@gmail.com>
- Name looks normal, but email is generic and not associated with any legitimate organization.
📌 Phishing Indicator: Suspicious sender using Gmail, no official domain.

✅ Step 3: Analyze Email Headers
-------------------------------
[Header analysis should be done using tools like MxToolbox or Google Admin Toolbox]
- In this case, Gmail marked it as spam and failed SPF check.
📌 Phishing Indicator: Header fails authentication, possible spoofing.

✅ Step 4: Inspect Links
------------------------
Examples from email:
- http://lovegfriend.fun/?gallery&s=Beauty_135z
- http://adultflirt.beauty/?&s_dis=tracking101_3&gallery
📌 Phishing Indicator: Unsecured HTTP links, adult themes, unrelated to any context.

✅ Step 5: Check for Suspicious Attachments
------------------------------------------
- No attachments, but dangerous links act as payloads.
📌 Phishing Indicator: Phishing via malicious links instead of files.

✅ Step 6: Look at the Language
------------------------------
- Manipulative emotional bait (“Do you remember me?”)
- Guilt-based text (“You disappeared after I shared my pictures.”)
- Some grammar issues and strange sentence structure.
📌 Phishing Indicator: Social engineering tactics and poor grammar.

✅ Step 7: Summarize the Phishing Traits
----------------------------------------
- Spoofed or fake sender address
- Suspicious links with hidden intent
- Emotional manipulation and guilt trips
- Likely part of a mass phishing campaign (repeated message over time)
- Marked as spam by Gmail automatically

🛡️ Awareness Outcome:
This hands-on analysis taught me how phishing emails are crafted using psychology, fake identities, and shady links.
